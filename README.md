## poe-to-gpt
A converter that transforms POE's API token into OpenAI's API format, enabling other applications that depend on OpenAI API to use POE's API.

This tool converts API keys provided by the Poe official website into compatible OpenAI API keys. It allows Poe API keys to be used with tools that rely on OpenAI API keys. The main reason for developing this tool is to provide convenience and stability for users in mainland China, who find it inconvenient to subscribe to and recharge OpenAI API.

Please note that **API keys are currently only available to Poe subscribers**.

Poe subscribers can get their API key at: [https://poe.com/api_key](https://poe.com/api_key)

**The new version simplifies the procedures and deployment methods.**
